# 239. Sliding Window Maximum
@(LeetCode)[Array, Hard]

```
Input: nums = [1,3,-1,-3,5,3,6,7], and k = 3
Output: [3,3,5,5,6,7] 
Explanation: 

Window position                Max
---------------               -----
[1  3  -1] -3  5  3  6  7       3
 1 [3  -1  -3] 5  3  6  7       3
 1  3 [-1  -3  5] 3  6  7       5
 1  3  -1 [-3  5  3] 6  7       5
 1  3  -1  -3 [5  3  6] 7       6
 1  3  -1  -3  5 [3  6  7]      7

**Use a deque to store only elements that need to be considered.**
1. A deque to store **indices** of elements need to be considered
	- check from tail, remove the elements that is smaller than current one
	- because for the next windows, current one is more likely than the smaller ones to be the "max"
3. The elements in deque must in the range [i-k+1, i]
4. The head of deque is always the max of current window
5. The deque contains at most k elements in descending order. Mostly there will be less than k elements, for that the non-promising elements(those smaller than their previous and next ones) are not in the deque

```java
public int[] maxSlidingWindow(int[] nums, int k) {
    if(nums == null || nums.length < 1)
        return nums;
    int[] res = new int[nums.length - k + 1];
    int j = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        if (!dq.isEmpty() && dq.peek() < i - k + 1) {
            // remove idx out of range
            dq.poll();
        }
        while (!dq.isEmpty() && nums[dq.peekLast()] < nums[i]) {
            // remove useless candidates
            dq.pollLast();
        }
        // add current one into deque
        dq.addLast(i);
        if (i >= k - 1) {
            // add into res array
            res[j++] = nums[dq.peek()];
        }
       
    }
     return res;
}
