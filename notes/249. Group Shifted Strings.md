# 249. Group Shifted Strings
@(LeetCode)[String, Medium]

> Given a string, we can "shift" each of its letter to its successive letter, for example: "abc" -> "bcd". We can keep "shifting" which forms the sequence:
"abc" -> "bcd" -> ... -> "xyz"
Given a list of strings which contains only lowercase alphabets, group all strings that belong to the same shifting sequence.
For example, given: ["abc", "bcd", "acef", "xyz", "az", "ba", "a", "z"], 
Return:
[
  ["abc","bcd","xyz"],
  ["az","ba"],
  ["acef"],
  ["a","z"]
]
Note: For the return value, each inner list's elements must follow the lexicographic order.

Compute the difference between characters, use the combination of diff as key in map.
```java
public List<List<String>> groupStrings(String[] strings) {
    Map<String, ArrayList<String>> map = new HashMap<String, ArrayList<String>>();
    for (String s : strings) {
        StringBuilder key = new StringBuilder();
        int diff = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i < s.length(); i++) {
            diff = s.charAt(i) - s.charAt(i - 1);
            diff += diff < 0 ? 26 : 0;
            key.append('a' + diff);
        }
        map.putIfAbsent(key.toString(), new ArrayList<>());
        map.get(key.toString()).add(s);
    }
    for (ArrayList<String> value : map.values()) {
     Collections.sort(value);
    }
    return new ArrayList<>(map.values());
}
```
