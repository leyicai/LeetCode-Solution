# 293&294. Flip Game
@(LeetCode)[String, Easy, Medium]

## 293. Possible states
> You are playing the following Flip Game with your friend: Given a string that contains only these two characters: + and -, you and your friend take turns to flip twoconsecutive "++" into "--". The game ends when a person can no longer make a move and therefore the other person will be the winner.
Write a function to compute all possible states of the string after one valid move.
For example, given s = "++++", after one move, it may become one of the following states:
[
  "--++",
  "+--+",
  "++--"
]
 If there is no valid move, return an empty list [].

```java
public List<String> generatePossibleNextMoves(String s) {
    List<String> res = new ArrayList<>();
    for (int i = 1; i < s.length(); i++) {
        if (s.charAt(i) == '+' && s.charAt(i - 1) == '+') {
            res.add(s.substring(0, i - 1) + "--" + s.substring(i + 1));
        }
    }
    return res;
}
```

## 294. Can starting player guarantee a win
> You are playing the following Flip Game with your friend: Given a string that contains only these two characters: + and -, you and your friend take turns to flip two consecutive "++" into "--". The game ends when a person can no longer make a move and therefore the other person will be the winner.
Write a function to determine if the starting player can guarantee a win.
Example:
Input: s = "++++"
Output: true 
Explanation: The starting player can guarantee a win by flipping the middle "++" to become "+--+".

Find the possible next state and check if next state can win. If not, this state is sure to win.

```java
public boolean canWin(String s) {
    for (int i = 1; i < s.length(); i++) {
        if (s.charAt(i) == '+' && s.charAt(i - 1) == '+') {
            if (!canWin(s.substring(0, i) + "--" + s.substring(i + 1)))
                return true;
        }
    }
    return false;
}
```
