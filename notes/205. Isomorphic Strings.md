# 205. Isomorphic Strings
@(LeetCode)[Easy, String, Hashmap]

> Two strings are isomorphic if the characters in s can be replaced to get t.
> All occurrences of a character must be replaced with another character while preserving the order of characters. No two characters may map to the same character but a character may map to itself.

Use two int[] as map to store occurrences of characters in two string
```java
public boolean isIsomorphic(String s, String t) {
    if (s.length() != t.length())
        return false;
    int[] m1 = new int[256];
    int[] m2 = new int[256];
    for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
        if (m1[s.charAt(i)] != m2[t.charAt(i)]) {
            return false;
        }
        m1[s.charAt(i)] = m2[t.charAt(i)] = i + 1;
    }
    return true;
}
```
