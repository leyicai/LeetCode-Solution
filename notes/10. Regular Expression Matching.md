# 10. Regular Expression Matching
@(LeetCode)[DP]
**`.` could be any char, `*` could be any length(include 0) of sequence of previous char**
- Optimal Structure: dp[i][j] denotes status of  if `s[0:i]` matches `p[0:j]`
	- if `s[i] == p[j] || p[j] == '.'`: dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1]
	- if `p[j] == '*'`:
		- if `p[j-1] != s[i]`: dp[i][j] = dp[i][j-2]
		- if `p[j-1] == s[i] || p[j-1] = '.`: 
			dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j] // a* as multiple a
												  || dp[i][j-1] // a* as single a
												  || dp[i][j-2] // a* as empty
