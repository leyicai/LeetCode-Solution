# 376. Wiggle Subsequence
@(LeetCode)[Array, Medium, DP, Greedy]

> A sequence of numbers is called a wiggle sequence if the differences between successive numbers strictly alternate between positive and negative. The first difference (if one exists) may be either positive or negative. A sequence with fewer than two elements is trivially a wiggle sequence.
> Given a sequence of integers, return the length of the longest subsequence that is a wiggle sequence. <u>A subsequence is obtained by deleting some number of elements (eventually, also zero) from the original sequence, leaving the remaining elements in their original order.</u>
> Input: [1,17,5,10,13,15,10,5,16,8]
> Output: 7
> Explanation: There are several subsequences that achieve this length. One is [1,17,10,13,10,16,8].

#### DP
- Two array recording the max length ending with`nums[i]` that wiggles up/down
- For each num, 3 possible states:
	1. up: `nums[i]>nums[i-1]` -> `up[i] = down[i-1]+1`
	2. down: `nums[i]<nums[i-1]` -> `down[i] = up[i-1] + 1`
	3. equal
- To reduce space, simply record `up[i-1]` and `down[i-1]`

```java
public int wiggleMaxLength(int[] nums) {
    if (nums == null || nums.length < 1) {
        return 0;
    }
    int up = 1, down = 1;
    for (int i = 1; i < nums.length; i++) {
        if (nums[i] > nums[i - 1])  // wiggle up
            up = down + 1;
        if (nums[i] < nums[i + 1])  // wiggle down
            down = up + 1;
        // equal: both up and down stay unchanged
    }
    return Math.max(up, down);
}
```

#### Greedy
Check each num, as long as it satisfy the wiggle requirement, increase the result.

```java
public int wiggleMaxLength(int[] nums) {
    if (nums == null || nums.length < 1) {
        return 0;
    }
    int res = 1, prevDiff = 0;
    for (int i = 1; i < nums.length; i++) {
        int diff = nums[i] - nums[i - 1];
        if ((prevDiff >= 0 && diff < 0) || (prevDiff <= 0 && diff > 0)) {
            // prevDiff = 0 only happens at the beginning
            res++;
            prevDiff = diff;
        }
    }
    return res;
}
```
